# Audio Assets

Place the following audio files in this directory:

- `pop.mp3`: Played when a notification is digested.
- `grow.mp3`: Played when a plant grows.
- `level_up.mp3`: Played when the garden levels up.
- `ambient.mp3`: Background ambient noise (optional).

The `AudioService` is designed to fail silently if these files are missing.
